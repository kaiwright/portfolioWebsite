# portfolioWebsite

## Description
The aim of this project was to make a portfolio using React that would help me showcase my abilities using the framework to potential employers. 

This was done by building the application from scratch, using the React template for guidance, and adding my files to build it up. I used React Bootstrap for most of the elements, making them easier to style and responsive.

In this project, I got a lot of practice with using React, as well as learning how to integrate different components and libraries. Overall, this project allowed me to demonstrate my proficiency in React and showcase my ability to create a functional web application.
